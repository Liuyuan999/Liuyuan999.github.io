<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Liuyuan Jiang, a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Rochester, advised by Dr. Lisha Chen. Earlier, I was in the Phd program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Dr. Tianyi Chen. With a background in statistics and mathematics, my academic focus lies in the realms of Optimization and Machine Learning. 

# üî• Research Interest

My research focuses on **bilevel optimization** and **multi-objective learning**, with applications spanning **financial pricing** models and **large language models (LLMs)**. I am particularly interested in developing efficient algorithms and theoretical insights that bridge the gap between optimization theory and real-world problems, enabling robust decision-making in complex, high-dimensional settings.
